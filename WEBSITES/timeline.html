                    <p class="timeline_content-desc">It consisted of beads on rods and was used for basic arithmetic calculations.
                        We all know that computers work through an interaction of hardware and software. The whole transformation and advancement of the computer goes back decades. However, there are five apparent generations of computers.Each generation is defined by a paramount technological development that changed how computers operate.</p>

                    <p class="timeline_content-desc">The 1940s saw the emergence of electronic computers, including the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) and the EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). These machines used vacuum tubes and punched cards for data processing.These computers were limited to solving one problem at a time. Input was predicated on punched cards and paper tape. Output emerged on printouts.</p>

                    <h4 class="timeline_content-title">Second Generation – Transistors (1956 – 1963)</h4>
                    <p class="timeline_content-desc">The language emerged from a binary language to a symbolic (‘assembly’) language. This meant programmers could discover instructions in words.Until 1965, computers were only used by mathematicians and engineers in a lab setting. Programma 101 changed everything by offering the general public a desktop computer that anyone could use. The 65-pound machine was the size of a typewriter and had 37 keys and a printer built-in. </p>

                    <p class="timeline_content-desc">Third-generation computers started using integrated circuits instead of transistors.Technically, the integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor material that contains thousands of transistors.Because of IC, the computer becomes more reliable and fast, requires less maintenance, is small in size, is more affordable, and generates less heat. You can see in the image above how multiple IC racks are used to power a computer.</p>

                    <p class="timeline_content-desc">Intel’s 4004 microprocessor marked a pivotal moment in computing history. It was the world’s first commercially available microprocessor and laid the groundwork for the personal computer revolution.The release of the IBM Personal Computer, powered by Microsoft’s MS-DOS operating system, marked the beginning of the personal computer era. It set industry standards and paved the way for the advancements of PCs.</p>

                    <p class="timeline_content-desc">This is the computer generation that we use. We know that computer devices with artificial intelligence technology are still in development.Still, some of these technologies are emerging and being used, such as voice recognition or ChatGPT. AI is an authenticity made possible by adopting parallel processing and superconductors. In the future, computers will be revolutionized again by quantum computation, molecular, and nanotechnology.</p>
